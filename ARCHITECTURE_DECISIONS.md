# Real-Time Analytics Dashboard - Architecture Decisions Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the key architectural decisions made during the development of a real-time sensor analytics dashboard capable of processing 1000 sensor readings per second and maintaining 100,000 data points in memory.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture (.NET Core)

#### Technology Stack Decision
- **Framework**: .NET Core 9.0
- **Real-time Communication**: SignalR
- **Data Storage**: In-memory with ConcurrentCollections
- **API Design**: RESTful with real-time WebSocket support

**Rationale**: .NET Core provides excellent performance for high-throughput scenarios, built-in dependency injection, and SignalR offers robust real-time communication capabilities.

#### Data Storage Strategy

**Decision**: In-memory storage using `ConcurrentQueue<T>` and `ConcurrentDictionary<T,K>`

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- **Pros**: 
  - Ultra-fast read/write operations
  - No database overhead
  - Simplified deployment
  - Excellent performance for 100K records
- **Cons**: 
  - Data loss on restart
  - Limited by available RAM
  - No persistence across deployments

**Alternative Rejected**: Redis/Database storage
**Why Rejected**: Added complexity and latency for POC requirements. For production, hybrid approach recommended.

#### Performance Optimizations Implemented

1. **Running Statistics Pattern**
   ```csharp
   private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, RunningStatistics> _runningStats = new();
   ```
   - Avoids recalculating statistics on every request
   - O(1) updates instead of O(n) calculations
   - Significant performance improvement for statistics endpoints

2. **Memory Management**
   - Automatic purging of data older than 24 hours
   - Circular buffer approach for maintaining 100K limit
   - Efficient memory usage patterns

3. **Concurrent Data Structures**
   - Thread-safe operations without explicit locking
   - Better performance under high concurrency
   - Reduced contention compared to traditional locking

#### Anomaly Detection Algorithm

**Decision**: Statistical outlier detection using 3-sigma rule

**Implementation**:
```csharp
var threshold = 3 * stdDev;
var deviation = Math.Abs(reading.Value - mean);
if (deviation > threshold) { /* Alert */ }
```

**Why This Approach**:
- Simple and effective for real-time processing
- Low computational overhead
- Suitable for various sensor types
- Configurable sensitivity levels

**AI Suggestion Rejected**: Machine learning-based anomaly detection
**Reason**: Too complex for POC, requires training data, higher computational cost

### Frontend Architecture (Angular)

#### Technology Stack Decision
- **Framework**: Angular 18
- **Charts**: Chart.js with real-time adapters
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 + Custom SCSS
- **Real-time**: SignalR client

**Rationale**: Angular provides excellent TypeScript support, robust component architecture, and good performance for real-time data visualization.

#### Real-time Data Handling

**Decision**: SignalR with reactive streams (RxJS)

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
this.signalRService.newReadings$.subscribe(readings => {
  this.recentReadings = [...readings, ...this.recentReadings].slice(0, 1000);
  this.updateChartData();
});
```

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Limit chart data points to 100 per sensor type
- Use Chart.js animation: duration: 0 for better performance
- Implement virtual scrolling for large data lists
- Debounced updates to prevent UI flooding

#### UI/UX Design Decisions

**Decision**: Dashboard-style layout with real-time indicators

**Key Features**:
- Color-coded severity levels for alerts
- Live status indicators with CSS animations
- Responsive grid layout
- Performance metrics display
- Filter capabilities by sensor type

**AI Suggestion Accepted**: Bootstrap component library
**Reason**: Rapid development, consistent styling, responsive design out-of-the-box

## Performance Validation

### Load Testing Methodology

1. **Concurrent Request Testing**
   - 10 concurrent connections
   - 30-second test duration per endpoint
   - Multiple endpoint testing

2. **Memory Usage Monitoring**
   - GC pressure analysis
   - Memory allocation patterns
   - Leak detection

3. **Real-time Performance**
   - SignalR connection stability
   - Message delivery latency
   - Client-side rendering performance

### Expected Performance Metrics

Based on architecture decisions:
- **Throughput**: 1000+ requests/second
- **Response Time**: <50ms for API calls
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB for 100K records
- **Real-time Latency**: <100ms end-to-end

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. Single-instance deployment
2. In-memory storage limits
3. No horizontal scaling

### Recommended Production Enhancements
1. **Data Persistence**: Hybrid approach with Redis + Database
2. **Load Balancing**: Multiple API instances with sticky sessions
3. **Message Queuing**: RabbitMQ/Azure Service Bus for reliability
4. **Monitoring**: Application Insights/Prometheus integration

## AI Tool Usage Analysis

### Effective AI Assistance
1. **Code Generation**: Boilerplate service classes and components
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Statistical calculations and data structures
3. **Configuration Files**: Angular and .NET configuration setup
4. **Documentation**: API documentation and code comments

### AI Suggestions Rejected
1. **Complex ML Algorithms**: Too heavy for real-time processing
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Overengineering for POC scope
3. **Database Normalization**: Unnecessary complexity for time-series data
4. **Advanced Caching Strategies**: In-memory approach sufficient

### AI Limitations Encountered
1. **Performance Tuning**: Required manual optimization
2. **Real-world Testing**: AI couldn't predict actual performance characteristics
3. **Integration Issues**: Manual debugging of SignalR connection problems
4. **Memory Management**: Fine-tuning required human expertise

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- CORS configuration for Angular frontend
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation on API endpoints

### Production Recommendations
- Authentication/Authorization (JWT)
- Rate limiting
- API key management
- Data encryption at rest

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Local development with HTTPS certificates
- Hot reload for both frontend and backend
- In-memory data for rapid iteration

### Production Recommendations
- Docker containerization
- Azure App Service or AWS ECS deployment
- CDN for Angular static files
- Health check endpoints

## Conclusion

The architecture successfully meets the POC requirements while maintaining simplicity and performance. The combination of .NET Core backend with Angular frontend provides a solid foundation for real-time analytics processing. Key performance optimizations and architectural decisions enable handling of the specified load while maintaining good user experience.

The strategic use of AI tools accelerated development while human expertise remained crucial for performance optimization and architectural decisions.
